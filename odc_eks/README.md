# Terraform Open Data Cube EKS Module: odc_eks

Terraform module designed to provision an Open Data Cube EKS cluster on AWS.

---

## Requirements

[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

[Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm#install)

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

[Fluxctl](https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/stable/tutorials/get-started.html) -(optional)

## Introduction

The module provisions the following resources:

- Creates VPC resources using [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc) module.
- Setup a new RDS instance with PostgreSQL database. Provide a snapshot ID to create the new RDS instance from existing RDS instance.\n
This is useful if migration is being performed to deploy a new infrastructure with pre-existing data indexed.

### Module Extensions(Optional Components)
- Setup a AWS CloudFront Distribution to support Open Data Cube web services
- Setup AWS WAF for web application security for web application.
- Issue a domain certificate using AWS Certificate Manager. It uses Route53 to validate certificate. 

## Usage

The complete Open Data Cube terraform AWS example is provided for kick start [here](https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-k8s-eks/tree/terraform-aws-odc/examples/stage).
Copy the example to create your own live repo to setup ODC infrastructure to run [jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) notebook and ODC web services to your own AWS account.
